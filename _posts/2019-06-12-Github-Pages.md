### Moved to Pages!

Kept you waiting, huh? I've finally migrated my blog to Github Pages for a couple of reasons.

1. I find the worksflow simpler. This removes as any barriers as possible to actually posting, as it's just write a Markdown post, commit, and push to remote.
2. It allows me to use a custom domain for free. My old page was a free one through Wordpress, and I could have either paid for a page with any of a million Wordpress hosts, or spend a ton of time managing my own Wordpress page. I would prefer to spend my time posting.
3. It allows me to work with some frontend rendering, jinja2 templating, etc, that is (kinda) relevant to what I do in my professional life.

### The year of Linux(ish) on the Desktop

I have also moved all of my development environments to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I've always been a Windows user, but have found that as I have learned more about scripting and development, I have found that in many cases, Windows can be a second class citizen. WSL gives Windows users the ability to use native Linux tooling in a Windows environment, including on files in your Windows filesystem. I will write a post in the coming days about how I have WSL set up on my machine. 

### A Programming Note

I'm sorry for the delay between posts. My hope is that finally streamlining my workflow will make posting less involved, allowing me to post more short-form content more frequently.
